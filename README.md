# AmiUX
AmiUX: A modern AmigaOS experience powered by Linux.

**Vision:**

AmiUX reimagines AmigaOS 3.x for the modern age, seamlessly integrating its classic charm with the power and flexibility of Linux. This hybrid approach preserves the rich legacy of Amiga software while unlocking access to contemporary hardware and software resources. AmiUX strives to be a unified and portable platform, running smoothly on a wide array of devices.

**Key Features:**

* **Legacy Compatibility:**  Run your favorite AmigaOS 3.x applications and games.
* **Modernized Interface:** Experience a refreshed AmigaOS interface powered by MUI5 and accelerated graphics (Vulkan/Wayland).
* **Linux Integration:** Seamlessly access Linux applications and resources directly from within the AmigaOS environment.
* **Enhanced Performance:** Enjoy improved performance and stability thanks to the underlying Linux foundation.
* **Cross-Platform Portability:**  Run AmiUX on a variety of hardware platforms supported by Linux.
* **PiStorm Compatibility (Planned):**  Bring new life to your classic Amiga hardware with a dedicated AmiUX PiStorm implementation.
* **Open Source Development:**  Join a vibrant community and contribute to the future of AmiUX.

**Architecture:**

AmiUX leverages an optimized AmigaOS 3.x emulator (WinUAE/FS-UAE/Amiberry) coupled with a custom interface manager on Linux.  Communication between AmigaOS and Linux is facilitated by OS3uae.library, enabling access to host resources and modern APIs. The PiStorm implementation interacts directly with classic Amiga hardware, creating a unique hybrid experience.
